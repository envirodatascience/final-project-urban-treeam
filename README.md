# Final Project for ENV 617 2024

## General Research Question:
How do street trees vary across New Haven, particularly as a result of specific management/planting choices?

## Importance of the project 
Urban tree cover is important for a myriad of reasons, ranging from public health to climate adaptation and mitigation. In New Haven, CT, one of the major agents in urban greening and tree planting is the Urban Resources Initiative (URI), a university-non profit partnership with Yale University. URI has been planting trees along streets and in parks across New Haven for almost 20 years, while also producing research focused on the practice of urban forestry. Recently, URI received a large ($2.6 million) grant from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Urban and Community Forestry Grant Program to plant more trees, specifically focusing on historically underserved, low-canopy neighborhoods. This essentially doubles the tree-planting goals that URI has, in terms of the number of trees planted, over the next five years.

### Biodiversity component 
URI prioritizes the diversity of tree species, avoiding planting too many individual trees of a single species or even a single genus in a small, localized area. The impact of emerald ash borer on white ash can exemplify the reason for this strategic approach. The outbreak of a pest or disease can cause detrimental effects on tree canopies when too many individuals are susceptible to that pest or disease and are planted in one location. 

Throughout the years, New Haven has experienced almost total canopy loss of affected species from different pests and diseases such as emerald ash borer, chestnut blight, and Dutch elm disease. 

URI aims to protect the trees by maintaining high levels of biodiversity, which will reduce and spread out the impact of future disturbances.
The biodiversity component of our project aims to understand the current levels of biodiversity and tree conditions in New Haven and to assess to what degree URI has succeeded.

#### Questions:
•	What is the most common tree species in New Haven?

•	What is the most biodiverse neighborhood in New Haven (street trees)?

•	What is the condition of street trees in New Haven?
